DPIR-1#1 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP dac_sys_i/our_dac_0/inst/our_dac_v1_0_S0_AXI_inst/u_dac666/U2_SineROM/square_wave2 input pin dac_sys_i/our_dac_0/inst/our_dac_v1_0_S0_AXI_inst/u_dac666/U2_SineROM/square_wave2/A[0] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.
